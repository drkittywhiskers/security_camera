# Security Camera Application

This is a simple security camera application that uses computer vision to detect motion and record video. The application can be used for home surveillance, office security, or other purposes.

## Installation

To use the application, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- OpenCV (version 4.5.1 or later)
- Python (version 3.7 or later)

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application by executing the `security_camera.py` file.

## Usage

To use the application, simply run the `security_camera.py` file and point your camera at the area you want to monitor. The application will detect any motion in the scene and record video to an output file (`output.avi`) when motion is detected.
